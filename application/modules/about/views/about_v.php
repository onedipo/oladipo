					<h5 class="head">OLADIPO SUNDAY AKA SUNNYCARES</h5>
					<h6>Birth </h6>
					<a class="title" href="single.html">On a special day, in an unusual place a colossus was born at exactly 4:05 am.</a>
					<a href="single.html"><img src="images/a1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Eager to happen on earth and with the Makers interest Oladipo Sunday arrived earlier than due date. Alas it seems hope of survival was lost. Though he was not told. He knew by the number of names he has that he was a miracle. Named after the day he was born-- Sunday-- and sealed with the only other name he has--Oluwadare; meaning God has justified me. Indeed the parents felt triumphant after all the ordeals. </p>
					<p>Today, Oladipo Sunday Oluwadare is nothing short of a miracle as he continues to scale new heights and surmount new mountains. His philosophy is "the more people you can help the more effective you become|" and |never give up on yourself".</p>
